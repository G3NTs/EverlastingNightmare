# The Game Concept
Our game is a third-person, top-down horror experience. The player controls a character trapped in darkness, moving around using the WASD keys. To fight the darkness, the player has a flashlight that they control with the mouse. The game takes place in what we called the "nightmare world." To escape, the player must find and collect 10 gems. Once all the gems are collected, the player can leave through a rift in the center of the map, completing the game.

While searching for gems, the player is hunted by small, one-eyed monsters with tentacles. These creatures lower the player's sanity when they get too close, eventually leading to death. The flashlight can freeze these monsters temporarily, giving the player a chance to escape.
